# Windows Dev Env

A quick(ish) automated way to build a reasonable dev env for Windows, by running
Linux on it. Takes ~30min on my machine with crappy DSL connection.

## TODO
- Use docker for provisioning
- Split it out so that it's not so focused on JS dev (will wait until I need Haskell or whatnot)
